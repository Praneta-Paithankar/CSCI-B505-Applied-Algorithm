Problem 1 :Given  a  numbern,  find  the  number  of  different  ways  to  writenasa sum of 1, 3 and 4.  You only have to output the number of differ-ent  partitions  -notthe  actual  partitions  itself.   Run  your  programon5 integer inputs of  sizes â‰¥10^5.   Provide  the  inputs  on  which you ran the program and the corresponding number of partitions foreach input.  Be careful with the initial conditions.
Following is a toy example.
Input:5
Output: 6 partitions
1.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2. 1 + 1 + 3
3.  1 + 3 + 1
4.  3 + 1 + 1
5.  4 + 16.  1 + 4


Problem 2: You are given a set of jobs.  Each job j has a start time sj and finish time fj.It  also  has  a  weight vj.   Two  jobs  are  compatible,  if  they do not overlap.  Goal is to find maximum weight subset of mutually compatible jobs.  Run your program on the two inputs provided.
