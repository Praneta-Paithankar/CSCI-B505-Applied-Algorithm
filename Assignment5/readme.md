Implement a Binary Search Tree data structure which supports the following queries:

insert(item)- Inserts item into the tree.

contains(item)- Returns True if item is in the tree, otherwise False.

print()-  Prints  elements  of  the  tree  inorder.  

size()- Returns the number of nodes in the tree.

smallest()- Returns the smallest element in the tree.

largest()- Returns the largest element in the tree.

Using the previously constructed BST class, write a function greaterSumTree()which  transforms  the  tree  such  that  each  node  contains  sum  of  all  nodesgreater than that node.
